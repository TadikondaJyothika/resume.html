<p><b>Blockchain based event detection and trust verification using Natural language processing and Machine Learning   April 2025</b></p>
<p>Developed a trust verification and automated event detection framework based on Blockchain, NLP, and ML 
technology. Blockchain technology offering solutions for event detection and trust verification. It proposes a decentralized, 
transparent framework that integrates Blockchain, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) to 
extract and verify event-related information from textual sources like news and social media. NLP techniques identify key 
entities, events, and sentiments, which are then recorded on the blockchain for tamper-proof storage. ML models analyse 
blockchain data to detect patterns, anomalies, and emerging trends. To assess credibility, a reputation scoring mechanism 
allows network participants to vote on the reliability of sources, ensuring trustworthy information. Experimental evaluations 
with real-world datasets demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in accurate event detection, misinformation prevention, and 
transparent data validation across various domains, such as journalism and social networks. </p>
